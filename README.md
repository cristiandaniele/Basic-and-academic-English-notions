# What is that?!

This repository will contain the English notions that I acquired about Basic English, Academic English and tricks to improve your scientific writing.

I've plenty of material to transcribe; I'll start from the easy stuff moving step by step to the more advanced techniques and notions.

I'll mainly use this repo as a diary to keep track of the lessons and organise the material. Therefore, some parts might be incomplete or partially incorrect.

I hope you enjoy browsing around :)
