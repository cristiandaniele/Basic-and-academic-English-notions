# 3. Present perfect simple

    [HAVE/HAS] + [PAST PARTICIPLE]

**We use present perfect simple:**
1. For something that started in the past and continues in the present
   > They **have been married** for fifty years.
2. When we are talking about our experience up to the present:
   > I **have played** the guitar ever since I was a teenager.
2. For something that happened in the past but is important in the present:
   > I can't get in the house. I **have lost** my keys!
      
**Examples**
1) *Affermative form:*
    > I **have seen** that film.
2) *Negative form*
    > I **have not seen** that film.
3) *Interrogative form*
    > **Have** you **seen** that film?

> **NB:**  You can't use the present perfect with adverbials to refer to a finished past time, but you can use it with adverbials which refer to a time which is not yet finished.

# 4. Present perfect continuous

    [HAVE/HAS] + BEEN + [-ing]

**We use present perfect continuous:**
1. To emphasise that something is continuing in the present:
    > It has been raining for hours

    > I've been working all day.

> **NB:**  Avoid using the present perfect continuous with stative verbs (verbs that describe a state of being, e.g. think, love, smell, etc.). In these cases use the present perfect simple.
