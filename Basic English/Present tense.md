# 3. Present perfect simple

    [HAVE/HAS] + [PAST PARTICIPLE]

**We use present perfect simple:**

1. To emphasise the completion of an event in the recent past.
   > I **have written** the Politics essay.
2. When we are talking about our experience up to the present:
   > I **have played** the guitar ever since I was a teenager.
3. For something that happened in the past but is important in the present:
   > I can't get in the house. I **have lost** my keys!
4. Sometimes, for something that started in the past and continues in the present
   > They **have been married** for fifty years.
      
**Examples**
- *Affermative form:*
    > I **have seen** that film.
- *Negative form*
    > I **have not seen** that film.
- *Interrogative form*
    > **Have** you **seen** that film?

> **NB:**  You can't use the present perfect with adverbials to refer to a finished past time, but you can use it with adverbials which refer to a time which is not yet finished.

# 4. Present perfect continuous

    [HAVE/HAS] + BEEN + [-ing]

**We use present perfect continuous:**
1. To emphasise that something is continuing in the present:
    > It has been raining for hours

    > I've been working all day.

> **NB:**  Avoid using the present perfect continuous with stative verbs (verbs that describe a state of being, e.g. think, love, smell, etc.) and with verbs of mental process (know, like, understand, etc). In these cases use the present perfect simple.

>**NB:** The present perfect continuous form is not normally used with verbs that refer to actions that are completed at a single point in time such as start, stop, and finish.

# Appendix

##Present simple and present perfect simple for future

You can use the present simple 
> We'll begin when everyone arrives

or the present perfect
> We'll begin when everyone has arrived.

to talk about the future in clauses (e.g. before, after, until, etc.).

## Differences between present perfect and present perfect continuous

In general the present perfect simple refers to something that has finished, while the present perfect continuous refers to something that is continuing in the present.

### Choosing either

In some cases, we can choose either of the tenses. This is usually the case when we are referring to matters in someone's life. Often we find the words for and since or some other time frame.

**Examples**
- He's eaten red meat his whole life
- He's been eating red meat his whole life
   >
- He's worked for the company since he was a teenager
- He's been working for the company since he was a teenager
   >
- I've lived here for three years
- I've been living here for three years
    >
- They've studied English since high school
- They've been studying English since high school

### Short-Term or Long-Term Action
We tend to use the present perfect continuous to emphasise the fact that an event or activity has been happening over a short period.

**Examples**
 - I've been playing tennis for two hours (short-term)

### Continuing or completed action

We usually use the present perfect simple to express single actions and the present perfect continuous to express repeated actions.

**Examples**

- Your wife has phoned you (may have been only once)
- Your wife has been phoning you - (she has rung many times)
